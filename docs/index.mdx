It currently supports Android, iOS, macOS and Web. Support for remaining platforms is incoming.

## Installation

In order to install the plugin, just add the latest version from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/location) in your `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
location: ^5.0.0
```

### Android

In order to display dialogs for asking the user to activate the GPS automatically and redirect to the Settings page,
you need to change the default theme of your app to `Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar` in `android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`

```xml
...
    <style name="NormalTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
        <item name="android:windowBackground">?android:colorBackground</item>
    </style
...
```
