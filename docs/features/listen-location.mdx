# Listen to Location

To listen to the location of the user, you can simply use

```dart
Stream<LocationData> get onLocationChanged
```

The stream will use the global settings for location tracking.
You can set the settings with [`setLocationSettings`](/features/settings).

If you change settings while listening to the location, the stream will be updated with the new settings (you can only have onn global settings active at the same time).

Don't forget to **cancel the stream** when you don't need it anymore. Otherwise the location will keep being tracked.

## Examples

### Listening to location location

```dart
final location = await getLocation();
print("Location: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}");
```

### With custom settings

```dart
final location = await getLocation(
    settings: LocationSettings(ignoreLastKnownPosition: true),
);
print("Location: ${location.latitude}, ${location.longitude}");
```
