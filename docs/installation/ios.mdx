# Install on iOS

## Minimum deployment target

In order to use Location, you need to set your minimum deployment target to iOS 13.0 or later.
Change the second line in your `ios/Podfile` into:

```
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

## Info.plist

In order to request location permissions, you need to add the following to your `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs the location</string>
```

The string will appear in the popup when the user is asked to grant location permissions.
